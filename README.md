This is an application I developed as a final project for completion of [Udacity](http://udacity.com) course [CS253](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253), Web Development a couple months ago. It was a very interesting course as it presented numerous challenges to really get you into the habbit of building robust and reliable web applications. I would urge anyone to give it a try. At the end you are presented with a certificate to kind of validate your newly acquired knowledge and expertise; it's not a fancy document, but it shows that you took the time to learn something new and that you're able to build web applications with Python.
