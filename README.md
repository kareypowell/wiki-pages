This is an application I developed as a final project for completion of [Udacity](http://udacity.com) course [CS253](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253), Web Development a couple months ago. It was a very interesting course as it presented numerous challenges to really get you into the habbit of building robust and reliable web applications. I would urge anyone to give it a try. At the end you are presented with a certificate to kind of validate your newly acquired knowledge and expertise; it's not a fancy document, but it shows that you took the time to learn something new and that you're able to build web applications with Python.

#### Usage

In order to get this project to run, you need to have Pyhton version 2.7 installed and Google App Engine [SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python) for Python. Then, rename the `app.example.yaml` to `app.yaml`

    $ mv app.example.yaml app.yaml

Follow the instructions for the GAE SDK to get the project imported and how to run it and you're all set! Also, remember to review 
the newly created `app.yaml` file and define your own **application** name and *SECRET_TOKEN*.
